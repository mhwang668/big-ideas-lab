# Reasons for choosing License and Code of Conduct
I specifically chose the Unilicense because it practically fits any open-source software that we could make on a github. As we are computer science majors, I felt that such a license would be appropriate as students who aren't making software for commerical purposes or anything.

The Code of Conduct was chosing as the Contibutor Covenant is an industry standard Code of Conduct. It is precise and simplistic in it's guidelines.
